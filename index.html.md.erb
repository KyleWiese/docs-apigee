<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This documentation describes the Apigee Edge Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The Apigee Edge Service Broker for PCF provides API management for applications running on PCF.

The Apigee Edge Service Broker for PCF registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. Developers create instances of the service plans using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to an application, creating an Apigee Edge API proxy that handles requests to that application. The proxy enables developers to manage their APIs through the Apigee Edge management console.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The Apigee Edge Service Broker for PCF enables developers to use the Apigee Edge API management functionality to handle requests between clients and their PCF applications. 

After creating an Apigee Edge API proxy, developers can access the Apigee Edge management console to enhance the proxy with the following features:

- Data transformation, mediation, orchestration, and policies for rate limits
- Security, such as authentication and Role-Based Access Control
- Onboarding, including a developer portal to enable self-service
- Analytics for monitoring and business metrics analysis
- Monetization for rate plans, internationalization, and usage tracking
