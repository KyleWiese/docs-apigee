This is documentation for Apigee Edge for Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;.

Apigee Edge provides API management for applications running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). With Apigee Edge's integration with PCF, you can access the Apigee Edge API 
management functionality between clients and your PCF applications. Using the cf CLI, 
you can create a new Edge API proxy that can handle requests sent to an existing PCF application. After the API proxy is created, you can enhance it with more
functionality and services, such as data transformation, security, onboarding, analytics, and monetization for rate plans and usage tracking. 

## Prerequisites

* An Apigee Edge account (Public Cloud or Private Cloud) with an organization where
API proxies can be created. To create an Edge account, see [Creating an Apigee Edge account](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/creating-apigee-edge-account). For more information about Apigee organizations, see [Organization structure](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/apigee-edge-organization-structure).
* A Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime 1.7 installation with Route Services enabled.
* Redis datastore, used by the broker to maintain route and binding configuration information.
