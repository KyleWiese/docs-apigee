1. Download the product file from Pivotal Network.

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded Apigee Edge Service Broker for PCF tile in the Ops Manager **Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

1. Under **Settings**, click **Apigee Edge Tile**.

1. Enter the appropriate values under **Custom Settings**. See the following table for a description of each setting and the default values for users of Apigee Edge for Public Cloud.

	 Setting | 	Description | Default for Public Cloud
	------- | -------- | -------------------------------
	**Dashboard URL** | This is the URL to the Apigee Edge management console, the UI where you develop and manage API proxy applications. | `https://enterprise.apigee.com/platform/#/`
	**Apigee Management API URL** | This is the endpoint URL to the Apigee Edge management API. The Apigee Edge Service Broker uses this URL when making requests to create new Apigee Edge API proxies for managing requests to PCF applications. | `https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1`
	**Apigee Proxy Domain** | This is the domain name that PCF applications use when making calls to your API proxy. | `apigee.net`
	**Apigee Proxy Host Template** | This is the template that describes how the Apigee Edge host name should be generated. PCF applications use this host when making calls to your API proxy. The template generates the host name from values specified when binding the PCF application to the service instance of the Apigee Edge service. Typically, `org` and `env` represent your Apigee Edge organization and environment names, and `domain` represents the proxy domain you specify above. Parts of this value not formatted as placeholders will be taken to be literal.| `${org}-${env}.${domain}`
	**Apigee Proxy Name Template** | This is the template that describes how to generate the name of your proxy when you create it from the cf CLI. | `cf-${routeName}`
